## 📌 Overview

The **School Portal Management System** is a modern, role-based web application designed to digitize and streamline core academic operations in K–12 institutions. Built with scalability, security, and user experience in mind, it provides a single interface for **administrators, faculty, parents, and accounts staff** to manage student records, attendance, fees, announcements, and disciplinary actions — all in real time.

This system reduces manual overhead, eliminates data silos, and enhances communication between stakeholders through a responsive, accessible, and intuitive UI.
